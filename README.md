## Usage

1. Enter the starting word and end word, also select which algorithms to be used
2. Click the submit button
3. Result will be displpayed

## Features
| Point | Yes | No |
|-----|-----|------|
|1. Program can be run | &check; | |
|2. Program can find a sequence of words from the start word to the end word according to the rules of the game using the UCS algorithm | &check; | |
|3. The solution provided by the UCS algorithm is optimal | &check; | |
|4. Program can find a sequence of words from the start word to the end word according to the rules of the game using the Greedy Best First Search algorithm | &check; | |
|5. Program can find a sequence of words from the start word to the end word according to the rules of the game using the A* algorithm | &check; | |
|6. The solution provided by the A* algorithm is optimal | &check; | |
|7. Program has a GUI | &check; | |

## Room for Improvement
1. Better encapsulation using the OOP principles to obey flexibility and modularity
2. Creating better and more functional GUI
3. Finding more ways to optimize the algorithm
